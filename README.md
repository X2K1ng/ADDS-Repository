Here are a few exercises to get you familiar with std::array:

    Basic Usage of std::array:
        Create an std::array of integers with a size of 5.
        Assign values to it using an initializer list.
        Print out the values using a range-based for loop.

    Accessing Elements:
        Create an std::array of double with size 10.
        Assign random values between 1 and 100 to it.
        Print the first, fifth, and last elements.

    Using Array Functions:
        Create an std::array of std::string with size 5.
        Use the fill method to assign the same string to all elements.
        Use the size method to print the size of the array.
        Print all the elements.

    Sorting an Array:
        Create an std::array of integers with a size of 10.
        Assign random values between 1 and 1000 to it.
        Use the std::sort function from the <algorithm> header to sort the array.
        Print the sorted array.

    Finding an Element:
        Create an std::array of char with size 26.
        Assign the English alphabets (a-z) to it.
        Use the std::find function from the <algorithm> header to check if a particular character is present in the array or not.

    Swapping Two Arrays:
        Create two std::array of integers with sizes 5.
        Assign some values to both arrays.
        Use the swap method to swap the contents of both arrays.
        Print the swapped arrays.

    Nested Arrays:
        Create an std::array whose elements are std::arrays of integers.
        Think of it as a matrix. Assign some values to this 2D array.
        Print the matrix using nested range-based for loops.

Once you've tried these exercises, you'll have a solid understanding of the basic operations you can perform with std::array. Remember to #include <array> at the beginning of your program to use the std::array functionalities.
